# Welcome to the Soton Sailbot's Github.io Page
You have found your way to the repo. Congratulations! Go crack a cold one.

## Building this Site
Get [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) first. You'll first need the [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/) gem hoster though. [Here's the download page](https://rubygems.org/pages/download). _However_, this pretty much requires you to have a Linux/Mac machine. It's quite iffy on Windows.

Once you have Jekyll up and running, fork this repo and start working on your version of the site! To run your site locally, simply hit `jekyll serve` in a terminal. More Jekyll commands will be listed in their site, or simply enter `jekyll` (with no subcommands) in the terminal.

## Any Questions?
Send me an email over at me@zhongyuen.dev. I'll try to answer to the best of my ability.
