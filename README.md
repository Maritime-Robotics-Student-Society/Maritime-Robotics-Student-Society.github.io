# Welcome
## To the Fork of the Soton Sailbot's Github.io Page
You have found your way to my fork of the repo. Congratulations. Go crack a cold one.

## Building this Site
Get [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) first. You'll first need the [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/) gem hoster though. [Here's the download page](https://rubygems.org/pages/download). _However_, this pretty much requires you to have a Linux/Mac machine. So unless you somehow manage to get RubyGems working on Windows, for one congratulations and two please show me how you did that. I want to know how to do that too.

Anywho, follow the instructions to install Jekyll in your computer. Then clone this repo, or fork the [main repo](https://github.com/Maritime-Robotics-Student-Society/Maritime-Robotics-Student-Society.github.io). Navigate to your clone, and start working on your version of the site! To run your site locally, simply hit `jekyll serve` in a terminal. More Jekyll commands will be listed in their site, or simply enter `jekyll` (with no subcommands) in the terminal.

## Any Questions?
Send me an email over at leezhongyuen@gmail.com. I'll try to answer to the best of my ability.
